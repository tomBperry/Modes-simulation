# Modes-simulation
Using p5.js to have an animation of simple harmonic modal systems.


Aim:
To be able to have a physics engine capable of showing the modal harmonic motion of systems shown in the first year lecture course.

In this branch I am exploring the horizontal mass system with 3 springs about fixed points with varying colour and thickness "springs".
