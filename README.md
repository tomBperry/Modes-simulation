# Modes-simulation
Using p5.js to have an animation of simple harmonic modal systems.


Aim:
To be able to have a physics engine capable of showing the modal harmonic motion of systems shown in the first year lecture course.

In this branch I am exploring the horizontal mass system with 3 springs about fixed points with varying colour and thickness "springs".


24/6/18:
Changed the displacement calculation to vectors and had this calculated before forces.


Centre of masses does not align with the join from the springs.


27/06/18:
To be able to simulate a lumpy string with variable parameters and then take to the continuous limit of a string with a uniform density and then to discontinuities with masses.

30/6/18:
Working example of an angle based lumpy string, want to add functionality to be
able to change the system parameters in the browser to have along side the
displacement based system and compare system evolution.
(eg frequencies, amplitudes, noise, breakdown at faster speeds)
